Add points of interest during rendering phase, not into density map
Do next layer via cubic interpolation including neighbors instead

Try completely different approach:
  Generate (thousands of) clusters of stars and draw them as additive glowing dots

Scale
  seed 1 = sum = 1.9M
  @ 100B stars, that's 52.6K per density value = 13.4M for a single core pixel
  @ 1B = 134K
  @ 100B, 512res = 3.3M
  @ 100B, 1024res = 838K

  How many layers of zoom to get ~50 stars on-screen at 100% density?
    if linear, @100B, and dividing by 4 each time, 15 zoom levels  (4^15 = 1B)
      that's looking at 3LY across, that's good
      zoom is 2^15 = 32K which means even a 1K texel gets subdivided into 32*32 screens at max zoom

  Milky Way is 105Kly in diameter
  1 LY = 63K au

  Elite Dangerous:
    galactic core: 3LY (parsec) cubed holds 10 million stars
    the bubble: 3-5 LY betweens closest stars? => 1 star per parsec!
    the fringe often 50LY between stars, more than 100LY in dark areas
  So, what if our density value is instead a "distance between stars"

Plan:
  galaxy top level is 128Kly across
  layer is a 256 density map plus points of interest
  new density map always a 4x reduction?
  output is a texture and a density map and we just blend them
